# Codify recurring bugs

## Working approach

Read project instructions and the relevant files, configuration, and existing scripts. Follow the requested scope and mode: report findings for a review, implement scoped fixes for cleanup, and add safeguards for a tooling request. With no mode specified, audit first. Preserve intended behavior and existing conventions; use existing tools before adding dependencies. Search for existing implementations before introducing new ones.

## Concern

Add a custom rule only for a demonstrated recurring mistake or a concrete incident. Capture the rationale and corrective action, and test both violations and legitimate cases. For example, double rounding may justify keeping calculation precision in services and rounding only at presentation boundaries; it does not justify a global ban on rounding.

## Verification and output

For findings, provide a file location, evidence, concrete risk, and the smallest useful fix. Separate observed defects from tooling suggestions. After changes, run relevant existing checks and add behavioral tests for meaningful fixes; state failures and anything unverified. Avoid blanket rewrites or suppressions to make checks green. Match effort to project lifetime and defect consequences. Verify current official tool documentation before adding a dependency.
